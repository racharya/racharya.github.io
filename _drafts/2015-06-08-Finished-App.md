It has been about 3 weeks and I have successfully completed building the first app- Bull's Eye game (this also means I have completed the iOS getting started book, YAY!!). This game is a guessing game where you want to put the Bull's eye as close as to the number given in the screen. The game is mainly composed of buttons, labels, and slider which work together to make this game an actual game.

I simply followed the book in building this app. We first started building this app by making a one button app which simply pops up an alert with a title and message. Then we move forward by putting all the UIcontrollers in the screen and modify the text in each labels. Then we moved into making one thing work at a time. This is where we used swift a lot. Everytime something is written using swift, the book goes over it and explains in great deal. This helped me understand what we did and why.  We kept building each controllers functions and then move into making it look pretty using colors, images, etc.Making it look pretty not only involved color but also paying attentions to the lunch screen, transition from lunch screen to the actual game, game name, game icon etc. I can't wait to show you the beautiful thing I have worked on for past couple weeks.

It is really something to have an app work just the way you expect it. Same was with me. I was very happy to see how the lame app turned into something exciting to play. If you get stuck anywhere in developing this app, there is author's resource files (comes with the book) to take advantage of. Even the author mentions about it at different points in the development.I did not have to refer to author's files to be honest because the book is that good. At the end of the first tutorial, I learned a lot of things about swift, Xcode, ViewControllers, Interface builders, how to make great apps, how to write code effectively, and how to think like a programmer. I have completed this app and I can't wait to start on the next tutorial. Because swift has just started making sense to me.
